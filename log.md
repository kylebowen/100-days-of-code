# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the toy_app from Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial.

**Thoughts:** Feels good to have started. Feels good to have _finished_ something- even if it's just a super small 'toy_app'. I know the '_rules_' say to avoid tutorials, but I'm ok with starting where I am. I have some ideas for projects to move on to once I finish working through the full tutorial.

### Day 1: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the sample_app from Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial. Got it installed locally, pushed to Github, and deployed to Heroku. I mean, it doesn't _do_ anything yet, but that will come.

**Thoughts:** Spent most of my time tracking down a bug that was stopping me from doing a `gem install` to get started. Turned out to be something from the interplay between Homebrew, RVM, and OpenSSL. Had to `brew uninstall --force --ignore-dependencies openssl` and then reinstall to get it working again. Felt a little bad spending most of my time debugging, but I guess that's just the way it goes sometimes.
